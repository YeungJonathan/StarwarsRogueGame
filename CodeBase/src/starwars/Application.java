/*
 * Change log
 * 2017-02-02	The TextInterface handles the responsibly of displaying the grid not the SWGrid or SWWorld classes (asel)
 * 2017-02-10	GridController controls the interactions with the user and will determine which UI it should use to do this. 
 * 			    Therefore there is tight coupling with the user interfaces and the driver. The application no longer has to worry about the
 * 				UI(asel)
 * 2017-02-19	Removed the show banner method. The text interface will deal with showing the banner. (asel)

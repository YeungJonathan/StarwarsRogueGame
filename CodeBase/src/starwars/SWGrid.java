 * Change log
 * 2017-01-20: 	Bug fix where the location of width 8 used to display a location of width 7
 * 2017-02-02: 	Removed the render method and the location width attributes. The rendering of the map
 * 				and displaying it is now the job of the UI. The dependency with EntityManager package was hence removed
 * 				and this resulted in a simpler SWGrid class (asel)

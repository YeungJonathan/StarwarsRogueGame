/*
 * Changelog
 * 
 * 2013-02-17: 	Initial version
 * 2013-02-18: 	introduced abstract base class so that simulations can have virtual
 * 				spaces of different dimensionalities, layouts, etc. (ram)
 * 2013-02-27: 	Moved into gridworld package. (ram)
 * 2013-03-07: 	Made abstract, since the render() method will be client specific. (ram)
 * 	    		Added EntityManager parameter so that clients can render items if they like. (ram)
 * 2013-04-10: 	Gave CompassBearing the ability to map back and forth from degrees (ram)
 * 2017-01-20: 	Added comments to methods for better understanding (asel)
 * 2017-02-03:	Added a getter method for the angle since it's required by the GUI to show move buttons in their corresponding directions
 * 2017-02-17:	Removed condition that checks preconditions in getLocationByCoordinates method. It is already handled by the assertions (Asel)
 * 2018-04-16:	Moved the validAngles attribute out of the CompassBearing class, as its use in the constructor causes errors in later IDEs (e.g. Eclipse Oxygen) (dsquire)
